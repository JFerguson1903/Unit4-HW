# Unit 4 Homework - Code Quiz

## Description

This quiz was created using Bootstrap CSS Framework, JavaScript, & jQuery. 

I was given the assignment through Triliogy/WASHU Coding Bootcamp to create a timed code quiz similar to one I might be asked to make during the interview process. The user story was that, I was to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can be gauged on my progress compared to my peers.

The additional acceptance criteria was as follows:

- WHEN I click the start button THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over THEN I can save my initials and score
